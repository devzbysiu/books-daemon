# <p id="about">About</p>

When you execute this program, it will go to the background and it will start
watching for the changes under specified (in settings file) directory.

When new file appears, daemon picks it up and sends it via bluetooth to specified device.

Under the hood, it uses `bt-obex` to send the file via bluetooth, so it's required to make this
software working.

See [configuration](#configuration) section to see what can be configured.

This software is rather for my internal use, but if you find it useful you can do stuff with it.

# <p id="installation">Installation</p>

Currently only Linux is supported.
- go to [releases](https://github.com/devzbysiu/books-daemon/releases) page
- download the latest `books-daemon` archive
- extract it
- run `books-daemon`

# <p id="configuration">Configuration</p>

Example configuration is shown below. `books-daemon` will look for settings file under
`~/.config/books-daemon.toml`.

```toml
interval = 2                          # how often check the content of the books_dir
books_dir = "/home/zbychu/books"      # where should it listen for new books
device_mac = "64:A5:F0:E9:AE:C6"      # device MAC number to which new books should be send
stdout_file = "/tmp/books_daemon.out" # stdout logs
stderr_file = "/tmp/books_daemon.err" # stderr logs
```
